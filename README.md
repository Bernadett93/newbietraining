My thesis for the software development
First step: Download the XAMPP Control Panel program, and this program will have a "htdocs" folder (usually c://xampp/htdocs). Download all files from the "WEB_NewbieTraining_SzentiBernadett" folder and copy these files to the htdocs folder.
Second step: Run the XAMPP, and start the Apache and MySQL module.
Third step: Open the localhost/phpmyadmin site, and import the "szakdolgozat_adatokkal.sql" file from the "Database" folder.
Fourth step: Now you can run the Newbie Training web site, you have to go to the "localhost" site.
Fifth step: You will find a file with name of "testdatas" and you can find different entitlements for the log in.
