<h1> Web Application</h1>
<b>First step:</b> Download the XAMPP Control Panel program, and this program will have a "htdocs" folder (usually c://xampp/htdocs). Download all files from the "WEB_NewbieTraining_SzentiBernadett" folder and copy these files to the htdocs folder.<br>
<b>Second step: </b>Run the XAMPP, and start the Apache and MySQL module.<br>
<b>Third step:</b> Open the localhost/phpmyadmin site, and import the "szakdolgozat_adatokkal.sql" file from the "Database" folder.<br>
<b>Fourth step:</b> Now you can run the Newbie Training web site, you have to go to the "localhost" site.<br>
<b>Fifth step:</b> You will find a file with name of "testdatas" and you can find different entitlements for the log in.<br>

If you want to visit the site without these configurations, you can reach this site here: https://newbietraining.000webhostapp.com/<br>
